# Implementation of computational methods
Repository for the TC2037 subject of the ITC study plan at the Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara. This repository contains all the taks, homeworks and projects done during the course. The final project was a scheme language syntactic highlighter that uses threads to get the job done faster and, as output, allows the user to see the inputed code colored part by part.

### My contribution - Aldo Alejandro Degollado Padilla
I was the team leader in this course. I conducted the team to develop the syntactic analizer and highliters. Also developed the working threads.
