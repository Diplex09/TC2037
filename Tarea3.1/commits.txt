4. Let X = (aa, bb) and Y = {λ, b, ab).

a) List the strings in the set XY.
	{aa, aab, aaab, bb, bbb, bbab}

b) How many strings of length 6 are there in X*?
	There are a total of 8 string, which are:
	{aaaaaa, bbbbbb, aaaabb, aabbaa, bbaaaa, aabbbb, bbbbaa, bbaabb}

c) List the strings in the set Y* of length three or less.
	{λ, b, ab, bb, bab, abb, bbb}

d) List the strings in the set X*Y* of length four or less.
	for X*={λ, aa, bb, aaaa, aabb, bbaa, bbbb}
	for Y*={λ, b, ab, bb, bab, abb, bbb, abab, babb, bbab, abbb, bbbb}
	X*Y*:{λ, b, ab, bb, bab, abb, bbb, abab, babb, bbab, abbb, bbbb, aa, aabaaab, aabb, aaaa, aabb, bbaa}

14. The set of strings over {a, b,c) in which all the a’s precede the b’s, which in turn precede the c’s. It is possible that there are no a’s, b’s, or c's.
	a^* b^* c^*

15. The same set as Exercise 14 without the null string.
	a^+ b^+ c^+

16. The set of strings over {a, b, c} with length three:

17. The set of strings over (a, b, c} with length less than three:

18. The set of strings over (a, b,c) with length greater than three.
	(a+b+c)(a+b+c)(a+b+c)(a+b+c)^+

19. The set of strings over {a, b} that contain the substring ab and have length greater than two.
	(a+b)*a(a+b)*b(a+b)*
